She has been so kind and helpful with our dogs. Her immense knowledge and genuine love of animals makes her the best Vet in my opinion! She is also very comforting for us neurotic pet parents too! I wish there were more stars because we'd give them all to her!</p>

So far, I have had dealings with Dr. Hallstrom and Dr. Schaefer, both were GREAT! competent, caring, compassionate. The staff is super friendly and helpful as well. Fortunately, they are our neighborhood vet, but, even if they weren't, I would go out of my way to deal with them. They ARE and will remain OUR VET!</p>
